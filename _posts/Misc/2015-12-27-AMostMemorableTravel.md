Few could imagine what is outside the Snow Mountain. Stretching from the end of the land to the end of the sky, the Snow Mountain is an insurmountable being, from the antediluvian past, and to the eternal future.

But there was a chance. Every year between April and June, the wind from the sea blows toward the Snow Mountain steadily and the weather remains sunny. Sometimes it only drizzles a little bit. If we could get something flying, we may be able to fly on the mountain!

My most memorable trip is a dabbling to surmount the insurmountable.  To say the trip was to surmount the mountain is inappropriate, for it was only a try to image the unimaginable and to see what was not seen.

Sam and Dominic agreed to join me. We bought a hot air balloon from the erstwhile circus and carried a lot of bread, desiccated beef and barrels of water. We even prepared some medicine. After consulting the local weather station, we confirmed the weather situation would be just perfect for a balloon trip in the following days. Then we set off.

The first day was boring. On the ground, there was only the endless forest. We could only get closer to the mountain by dusk. The verdant forest didn’t go further. We could even feel the breath of the Snow Mountain at the edge of the forest. After the forest was the grassland. We didn’t stop at night. The balloon kept going. Sam, Dominic and I kept watch at night in turn.

In the second half of the night, it was my turn to keep watch. Dominic woke me and fell into snoring quickly. The sky at night was beautiful, dotted with stars.

About at noon of the second day, we finally reached the edge of the mountain. The Snow Mountain revealed itself in front of our eyes. We were excited. The mountain peaks were not very high, but they were fully covered with snow. Below the snow hats, some vegetation still grew doggedly. From this edge of the mountains, we could not see the other edge. The mountains sprawled out to every direction except where we came. The white hats, fog, and sky blended into one at the end of sight.

After the excitement of the beginning, we got bored again by the endless repeating of white hats and dogged green rags. The third day and the fourth day were all the same.

At night of the fourth day, it was again my turn to keep watch. I leaned against one side of the basket, eating beef. I lost myself in rumination.

Some lived a peaceful life. Yet there were some paths that could be followed to reach a better, or a new realm. Then why could they enjoy their life, steady and mundane? I could also live an undisturbed life if I wished. But as I saw the endless repetition, pointless exhaustion but still gaining little, I would better find a path leading to a new world.

On the fifth day, we thought it would be just the same as before. But some white dots emerged in the far away. We used the telescope and found that were a line of eagles. They were not harmless as we assumed. They marched toward us and suddenly began to shoot on the food bags hung on the basket. Sam and I quickly put some beef bags back into the basket. Dominic used a crossbow to shoot the eagles. Dominic was a trained hunter. He shot three of the eagles down. The others scattered away. But we also lost one bag of bread and one bag of beef. The bags fell into the mountain oceans and disappeared. We decided not to find them back.

At the dawn of the seventh day, we saw some remains of walls on one peak, which obtruded out of other peaks markedly. Our hearts got thrilled again. We landed among the ruins. After searching for a while, we found a towering building preserved complete. We knocked the door and asked if there was anybody home. To our astonishment, the door opened ajar and a hoary man with white robe appeared.

He greeted us and let us in the tower to have a tea. We were eager to ask who he was and what he was doing in the middle of ruins.

“My name is Gandalf. I am maybe someone you called wizard, and I’m doing some experiments of transmuting different forms of energy into each other. Drink the tea and I’ll tell you more.”

Then we drank the tea and fell asleep.

The next day I woke up on the bed of my room in hometown. It seemed as if I had a long dream of traveling on a hot air balloon. But I did remember that I had traveled by air balloon, which turned out to be extremely boring, or which turned out very exciting as if we had a tea with a wizard. The two memories existed the same time although they seemed to be contradictory. That’s weird.

Anyway, the trip on hot air balloon was a most memorable trip beyond any doubt.
